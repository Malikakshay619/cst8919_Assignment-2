## Introduction

In this report, I‚Äôve compared some of the Azure services we‚Äôve used in class with their closest alternatives in AWS and Google Cloud. The goal is to see not just what each platform offers, but also how they differ in pricing, security, and how well they fit into a DevSecOps workflow.  

To make this easier to follow, I‚Äôve included a quick comparison table first, and then short explanations for each service.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Azure | AWS Equivalent | GCP Equivalent | Key Takeaway |
|-------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Microsoft Entra ID** | IAM Identity Center | Cloud Identity + IAM | All provide identity, SSO, and MFA. Microsoft focuses on Conditional Access, AWS centralizes SSO, and GCP emphasizes directory + IAM together. |
| **Azure Monitor + Log Analytics** | CloudWatch (+ CloudTrail) | Cloud Monitoring + Logging | All provide metrics, logs, alerts, dashboards. Azure uses KQL, AWS has CloudWatch Logs Insights, GCP is tied closely to SLOs. |
| **Azure Policy** | Config (+ SCPs) | Org Policy Service | All three enforce guardrails. Azure‚Äôs policies are prescriptive, AWS Config evaluates configs, GCP focuses on project/org hierarchy. |
| **Defender for Cloud** | Security Hub + GuardDuty + Inspector | Security Command Center | Azure and GCP have an all-in-one approach, AWS breaks it into multiple services. |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | Security Lake + Athena/OpenSearch | Google Security Operations (Chronicle) | Microsoft and Google have first-party SIEMs, AWS relies on partners or Security Lake integrations. |

## Identity and Access Management

- **Azure (Entra ID):** Strong on conditional access, MFA, and ties neatly into Office 365.  
- **AWS:** Identity Center is free and good for SSO across accounts, but it leans on IAM for fine-grained controls.  
- **GCP:** Cloud Identity + IAM covers both directory and permissions.  

üëâ *My take*: Entra ID makes sense if you‚Äôre already in the Microsoft ecosystem. AWS works well if you‚Äôre all-in on AWS. GCP is clean and integrates with G-Suite.

## Observability & Monitoring

- **Azure Monitor + Log Analytics:** KQL queries are powerful, dashboards are polished, and it integrates with Defender and Sentinel.  
- **AWS CloudWatch:** Central tool for metrics/logs/alarms, but you often need CloudTrail for audit logs.  
- **GCP Cloud Ops Suite:** Great for SRE-style monitoring, with logging and SLO tracking built-in.  

üëâ *My take*: Azure is great for data queries, GCP shines for reliability engineering, AWS is consistent but sometimes feels spread out.  

---

## Policy & Governance

- **Azure Policy:** Easy to enforce rules like ‚Äúdeny if not in Canada Central.‚Äù  
- **AWS Config + SCPs:** Very flexible but requires more setup.  
- **GCP Org Policy:** Fits perfectly into Google‚Äôs org/folder/project model.  

üëâ *My take*: Azure is easiest to start with, AWS gives the most customization, and GCP is neat and structured.  

---

## Cloud Security Posture Management

- **Azure Defender for Cloud:** Multicloud coverage, attack path analysis, container and VM protection.  
- **AWS:** Split into multiple services‚ÄîSecurity Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie.  
- **GCP SCC:** Centralized like Azure, good asset inventory and risk scoring.  

üëâ *My take*: Azure and GCP are easier ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù options. AWS is modular but more work.  

---

## SIEM & SOAR

- **Microsoft Sentinel:** Mature SIEM with lots of connectors, strong KQL queries, and new Sentinel Data Lake for cheaper storage.  
- **AWS:** Doesn‚Äôt have a native SIEM‚Äîyou build it with Security Lake and query engines.  
- **Google Chronicle:** Cloud-native SIEM with generous hot data retention (up to 12 months).  

üëâ *My take*: Microsoft and Google are ahead here. AWS feels like ‚Äúbuild your own SIEM.‚Äù  

---

## Conclusion

Each provider takes a different angle:  
- **Microsoft**: integrated and user-friendly.  
- **AWS**: flexible and modular, but fragmented.  
- **GCP**: structured, reliability-focused, and strong on analytics.  

There‚Äôs no universal ‚Äúbest‚Äù‚Äîit really depends on the organization‚Äôs existing stack and priorities.
